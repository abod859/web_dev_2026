                    My name is Abdullah Alhaideri, and I am a student majoring in Information and Communication
                    Technology (ICT). I am interested in learning how web technologies work and how websites
                    are structured using semantic HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy learning by building small projects and improving them step by step.
                    Writing code and creating websites is a great way for me to practice and apply what I learn in my courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                     My goal is to create pages that are clear and well-structured, and easy to navigate for users.

                <h3>Current Studies</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently taking courses focused on web development, accessibility, and information
                    architecture. These courses help me understand how to build websites that are usable,
                    accessible, and well organized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to learning HTML, I am practicing using GitHub to manage my work and publish my site.
                    This workflow helps me track changes and improve my projects over time.
                    This project is an opportunity for me to practice these skills and create a simple personal website.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    I aim to continue improving my web development skills, 
                    and I want to build a strong foundation in HTML before moving on to CSS and more advanced topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also hope to explore more about how to create accessible websites that can be used by everyone, 
                    regardless of their abilities or the devices they use.
