                <h3>About This Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This website is a personal project created as part of an ICT course. The main goal of this site
                    is to practice building structured and semantic HTML5 pages without using CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website consists of three main pages: Home, About Me, and Hobbies. Each page is designed to
                    provide clear and organized information about me and my interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you find this website informative and easy to navigate. Feel free to explore the different
                    sections to learn more about me and my hobbies.

                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a student studying Information and Communication Technology (ICT). I am learning how to build
                    websites using HTML5 while focusing on accessibility, usability, and clear content structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about technology and enjoy exploring new tools and techniques in web development.
                    This project is an opportunity for me to apply what I've learned and create a simple, yet effective
                    personal website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look forward to sharing more about myself and my interests on this website, and I hope it serves
                    as a useful example of how to create a well-structured HTML5 site.
                </p>
